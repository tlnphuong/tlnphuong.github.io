An ETL-driven solution for a bike-share company, Cyclistic, in New York City. This project is part of the Google Business Intelligence Professional Certificate on Coursera. In this project, I automated 2 dashboards that lend insights into bike-share traffic, seasonality, and weather impact on 60 million bike trips in New York city by implementing an ETL data pipeline that extracted necessary data from 4 different data sources, aggregated metrics, and loaded the transformed data to target tables and views used for dashboard design in Tableau.

Tools used: SQL (Google BigQuery in Google Cloud), ETL pipeline (Google Dataflow), and Tableau.
